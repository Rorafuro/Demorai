# ðŸ¥· Demorai

A **SourceMod** Plugin for Team Fortress 2.

### What is Demorai?

Demorai is a plugin that asks the important question:
- **What if the Demoman was a samurai?**

This plugin transforms your favorite one-eyed, kaboom-loving Scotsman into a blade-wielding warrior of dubious honor and even more dubious sobriety.

### Features

- **Demoman becomes a Samurai.**
  Eyes glow once blade has tasted blood, and allows demoman to press 'R' to teleport.

- **Optional Soldier Samurai Support (Coming Soonâ„¢).**
  Optional. Dangerous. Probably yelling about Sun Tzu.

### Installation
1. Install like any other SourceMod plugin.
2. Add to your plugins folder.
3. Restart server.
4. Profit.

### Known Issues
- Demoman refuses to fight unless "the blade has tasted blood."
- Occasionally challenges teammates to duels during setup.

### Credits
- Inspired by the ancient scrolls of VSH-Rewrite.
- Written by some honorable fools who thought this was a good idea.
